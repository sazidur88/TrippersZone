        <h2> 3.0 Design Specification</h2>
        <div id="paragraph">
        This content provides a basic overview of the design procedures of a few key components 
        of the system. The tables will exhibit more details on key components:<br>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li> Database: We will use MySQL in our database system. It will contain tables to
          describe diverse classes of information and will likewise discuss connections and 
          dependencies between each table. </li><br>

          <li> Server Software: Our server software will directly manipulate the contents of 
          the database, based on commands from the Server Procedure Proxy. </li><br>
          
          <li> The User Software will live on a workstation and will be likewise accessible 
          on mobile device. Its motivation is to display information to the user as asked for, 
          and give an interface with the goal that the user can access easily. </li> <br>
          
          <li> Android User: The Android will allow the user to view the system and make
          simple changes to data regarding that particular user.
          </li>
        </ul>
        </div>


        <h2> 3.1  Component Interaction</h2>
      <div id="paragraph">
        <li>The "TrippersZone" design has been divided into three major sub-system; server application, 
        user applications and database system. In general the server application is  separated into five major 
        subsections; the server component, server communication, server GUI (Graphical User Interface), 
        all information in database and shows in table with graphical interface. The user application 
        separated into two subsections: the client component and the client communication.</li>
        <br>
        <br>


        <li>The server application’s major design considerations include easy database store, easy database update and delete option and a minimal set of administrative features. The server application has been designed to be as flexible as possible. Given the project’s constraints of human resources, software resources, and time, the server is not completely “data independent”.Portions of the server application are specific to this automated accommodation. This portion are discussed in the server application detailed design strategies.</li>
        <br>
        <br>


        <li>The client application is designed to support the following major feature: simple search of houses, see the details given by owner, and a communication system between client and renter. Additionally on the other hand client can post his vacent available houses.</li>
        <br>
        <br>


        <li>Unlike the server application, the user application has been designed completely data
        independent but with very strong user information privacy. No portion of the user application is 
        independented with their information, pictures and other related things. This provides flexibility for other potential uses for the user application.</li>
        <br>
        <br>


        <li>Given the system’s requirement that the user application must be supported on a web platform, 
        the design uses several web specific technologies like Django, html5, css3, bootstrap, PHP. And 
        specially also build for android users “android application”. This technology is chosen because
        they required the least amount of research and learning time, both of which we are limited in. </li>
